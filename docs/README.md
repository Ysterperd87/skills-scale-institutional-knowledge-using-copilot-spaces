# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This README provides a brief overview of how OctoAcme manages projects and serves as the single entry point for navigating all process documents in this folder.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, customer-first approach to project management built on iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions. Every project progresses through five lifecycle stages — Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Close/Retrospective — ensuring that work is well-scoped before it starts, tracked transparently during delivery, and reviewed for continuous improvement after it ships.

Roles are clearly defined across three core personas: the **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; the **Product Manager (PdM)** defines outcomes, owns the backlog, and measures success; and **Developers** implement features while collaborating on design, testing, and documentation. Supporting roles such as QA/Testing and stakeholders provide validation and approvals throughout the lifecycle.

Communication follows a predictable cadence — weekly PM/PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates — supplemented by a risk register, escalation paths, and an incident playbook to handle unplanned issues. Quality assurance is woven into every stage through acceptance criteria, a Definition of Done, code reviews, and post-release verification, reinforcing OctoAcme's commitment to reliable, high-quality delivery.

Retrospectives close each project by capturing learnings and turning them into actionable improvements, ensuring OctoAcme's processes evolve over time. Together, these workflows, roles, communication strategies, and quality practices form a cohesive system that helps teams deliver value consistently and transparently.
